The project consists of optimizing doctors appointments based on previous interactios from patients with a bot. To achive that goal we were using NLP as well as behavioral classification model. 

Directories: 
* **/Cleaning**: Takes care of the data cleaning part of the dataset, and we output it in a format suitable for working with NLP. Additionaly we created new features to pass them to the model and to run exploratory data analysis. 

* **/Models**: Where we ran the both NLP baseline and bert model and the classification one. 

* **/Other Analysis**: Contains the noteboks we used to extract the insights pf the project (Sentiment analysis, BERT explainability, Bag of Words)

* **/Inputs**: Datasets (Hidden in Github for NDA)
